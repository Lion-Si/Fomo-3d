## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then, you can generate static files in the /out folder through build:

```build
npm run build
# or
yarn build
--> output /out
```

Open [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:8001/api/hello](http://localhost:8001/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
